We will accept any pull requests if they meet the following requirements:

- It must still compile
- The pull request description should not bother us with unnecessarry details. Instead of saying "optimized this or that method" it should just say "PERFORMANCE BOOSTS" or something like that.
- Comments should be either useless or non-existent. We don't want to waste time reading comments.
